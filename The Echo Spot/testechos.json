I'm actually more interested in another aspect of this scandal that effects us more... The Vice Provost of the Office for Student Affairs, Danita M Brown Young, directly emailed one of the student's personal email address. Does that strike anybody else as super sketchy? I'm curious, as students, can the administration access any of our emails or personal records without a warrant? What about for Echospot? When we check the anonymous box on an Echo are we really anonymous? http://whosediversity.weebly.com/endorsements.html"},
